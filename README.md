This repo enables active data collection to add during training, built off the amazing work done by the [http://docs.nerfstudio.com]nerfstudio team, and is the codebase for `Data Augmentation for NeRFs in the Low Data Limit` [submitted to ICRA '25].

### Notes:
- The file `data/transforms_300.json` was collected using Blender. Be sure to follow Mildenhall et al.'s work on that.
